# SkillCred_Quiz_Creator

SkillCred Quiz Creator is a user-friendly application designed to *simplify quiz creation*. Users can provide source material by **pasting text directly or uploading various document files** (like PDFs, Word docs, or images). They then specify their desired **quiz configuration**, including the number of multiple-choice and true/false questions, and an optional focus topic. The app leverages **AI to generate tailored questions**, which users can *review, edit, add, or delete*. Finally, the perfected quiz can be **exported to common formats like PDF or Word** for easy sharing and use.
